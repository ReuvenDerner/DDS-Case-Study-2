# DDS-Case-Study-2: Company Culture and Employee Attrition 

## Introduction to the Project
Identify top three factors that contribute to job turnover and discern job role specific trends as well as relevant observations backed by statistical analysis. Utilize logistic regression to obtain AIC of the model containing the aforementioned top factors in addition to Na√Øve Bayes and linear regression to deploy prediction models for attrition and monthly salary.

## Executive Summary
Employee retention is a crucial cost-effective measure for businesses in addition to a host of nonfiscal benefits such as morale, productivity, and cultural impact. My partner and I identified overtime, job involvement, and years in current role as the top drivers of attrition (AIC 665). Additionally, we observed a negatiave correlation between salary and attrition rate. This trend intuitively made sense to us but is there a confounding factor? We looked at the job satisfaction level, particularly the highest self-rated level of dissatisfaction, and discovered a positive correlation between salary and job dissatisfaction. Thus salary is the biggest driver of attrition among job roles, despite their job satisfaction.
